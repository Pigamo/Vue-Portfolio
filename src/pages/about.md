## Starting out

I started coding when I really wanted to bring my game ideas to life. I remember starting out asking some Unity addon guy to create an array for me.. We won't talk about that anymore.

Since then I went on to make more games, spending long hours trying to bring my ideas to life. While I never made any money on game design (so far), I still hold it in my heart as my true passion, waiting for me to return.

## Me now

I make my living now making websites for clients, sometimes simple, hopefully complex (I like solving problems rather than visual design). 

I almost ended that last sentence with a semi colon; 
```js
function I_suck_at_coding(money: float) {
  let wallet = money
  const burgers = money
  wallet -= burgers

  // !TODO: Save money
}
```

Anyways, I have an eclectic collection of delectable projects I've elected to select. I hope one of them is cool enough.

## Me when not on computer

I am a musician, started on the cello when I was like 5. Decided 10 years later after wanting to play videogame music that I needed to learn piano. Nowadays I can play Chopin and Liszt _relatively_ easily. Completely self taught, thanks Synthesia!

I like to pilot my drone when I find a nice open field to play in. I also am an amateur videographer and photographer, using that as a means to spruce up the deal when securing clients.

I want to go live in Korea, as I have been learning the language and need a change of scenery.
